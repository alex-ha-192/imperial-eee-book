# imperial-eee-book

## Help! I just want to read the book, not contribute to it!
We don't have enough content to actually release this onto a web server yet, but it's coming soon!
In the meantime, we would love it if you could contribute to it in some capacity and help us get this to a production-ready state.

## OK, I want to contribute. How can I do that?
Clone the repo and make sure you have both Rust [(get it here)](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)  and mdBook [(get it here)](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html) installed. All the markdown files are in the src/ directory, and make sure to reflect any new pages in src/SUMMARY.md.

## Do you have a style guide?
Not yet, but we're working on one!

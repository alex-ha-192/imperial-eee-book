# imperial-eee-book

## Help! I just want to read the book, not contribute to it!
The book is available online on GitHub Pages [here](https://alex-ha-192.github.io/imperial-eee-book/).
We would love it if you could contribute to it in some capacity and help us get this to a more complete state.

## OK, I want to contribute. How can I do that?
If you just want to write for the Book, all you need as an editor that can handle Markdown (.md). Clone the repo and get going! Thanks a ton for the help!
All the markdown files are in the src/ directory, and make sure to reflect any new pages in src/SUMMARY.md.

If you want to change the nitty-gritty (configuration etc.), then you'll need to clone the repo and make sure you have both Rust [(get it here)](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)  and mdBook [(get it here)](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html) installed.

## Do you have a style guide?
Not yet, but we're working on one!

## I can't make equations! What's the point of this if it can't do equations!
My friend, we have stumbled upon the great revelation of our times: **mdBook has MathJax support**. Simply place down a \\\\( [LaTeX equation] \\\\) and the equation shall appear in the book as if by magic. For more information, [look here](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/mathjax.html).

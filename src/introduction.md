# Imperial EEE/EIE Book

This book is intended as a resource for EEE and EIE students at Imperial College London, collating all the information you need to know so you can look back, long after your lectures have faded from memory, and remind yourself what's going on.

This book is currently in an extremely incomplete state, so we urge anyone who can to help us expand this book with more content so it can be as useful as possible to other Imperial students.

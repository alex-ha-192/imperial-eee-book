# Style guide

When contributing towards the Book, please keep the following guidelines in mind, so that the Book can be easy to read and contribute to in the future.

## Level of complexity
These notes are intended to be used by a a student currently studying the module they're reading about, or having just completed it. Please do not refer to knowledge that would not be expected of a reader at this level, and make sure your reasoning is easy to follow.

## MathJax
Feel free to use both inline and block MathJax wherever it could be useful. However, please be liberal with spaces when writing MathJax terms. This makes them more readable and legible to anyone who wants to understand or edit it later.

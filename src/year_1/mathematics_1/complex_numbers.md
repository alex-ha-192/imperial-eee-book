# Complex numbers
Complex numbers are numbers that do not have to be real. This can be useful in solving quadratic equations, and especially with regards to engineering, where they can be used in wave equations and the like.
## Imaginary numbers
Numbers of the form \\( a \sqrt{-1} \\) can be represented using the construction \\( i = \sqrt{-1} \\).

\\( i \\) is an **imaginary number**, as opposed to the real numbers (\\( 1, 5, -10, \sqrt{2}, \frac{\pi}{4} \\) etc.). The set of imaginary numbers is much like the set of real numbers, except with the base unit switched from units of 1 to units of \\( i \\). For example, the imaginary numbers include \\( i, -i, 2.5i, e^2 i, \sqrt{43}i \\) and so on.
